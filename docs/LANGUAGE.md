# Orus Language Reference

This document provides a comprehensive reference for the Orus programming language (version 0.1.0).
All examples are taken from the programs located in the `tests/` directory.

## Primitive Types

Orus supports the following built-in primitive types:

- `i32` – Signed 32-bit integers (range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
- `u32` – Unsigned 32-bit integers (range: 0 to 4,294,967,295)
- `f64` – 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point numbers (double precision)
- `bool` – Boolean values, represented as either `true` or `false`
- `string` – UTF-8 encoded text strings
- `nil` – Absence of a value, automatically returned from functions without an explicit return statement

Examples:
```orus
let signed_int: i32 = -42
let unsigned_int: u32 = 100
let float_num: f64 = 3.14159
let boolean: bool = true
let text: string = "Hello, Orus"
```

## Compound Types

Orus provides two primary compound data types:

### Arrays

Arrays are fixed-length collections declared with the syntax `[ElementType; Size]`. Arrays are zero-indexed and can be accessed using square bracket notation.

Declaration and initialization:
```orus
// Declare an array of 5 integers
let numbers: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

// Access array elements (zero-indexed)
let first = numbers[0]  // 1
let third = numbers[2]  // 3

// Modify array elements
numbers[1] = 20

// Multidimensional arrays
let matrix: [i32; 2][2] = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
let value = matrix[0][1]  // 2
```

### Dynamic Arrays

While arrays have a fixed declared size, they can grow dynamically when used with these built-in functions:

- `push(array, element)` – Appends an element to the end of an array, automatically expanding capacity
- `pop(array)` – Removes and returns the last element of an array
- `len(array)` – Returns the current length of an array

Example:
```orus
let numbers: [i32; 1] = [0]  // Initial capacity of 1
push(numbers, 10)            // Array grows to size 2
push(numbers, 20)            // Array grows to size 3
print(len(numbers))          // Prints 3
let last = pop(numbers)      // last = 20, array size back to 2
```

### Structs

Structs are user-defined record types with named fields. They are defined using the `struct` keyword.

Definition and instantiation:
```orus
// Define a struct
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32
}

// Instantiate a struct
let p1 = Point{x: 10, y: 20}

// Access struct fields
let x_value = p1.x
```

## Variables

Variables are introduced with the `let` keyword and follow these rules:

- All variables must be explicitly declared before use
- Type annotations are optional when the type can be inferred
- Variables can be reassigned with a compatible value
- Variable scope is block-based
- Variables cannot be declared outside functions
- Variable names follow the common identifier rules (letters, digits, underscore; must start with letter/underscore)

Examples:
```orus
let count = 0                 // Type inference (i32)
let text: string = "hello"    // Explicit type annotation
let flag = true               // Type inference (bool)

// Reassignment 
count = 10                    // Simple reassignment

// Block scope
{
    let local = 5             // Only visible in this block
}
// local is not accessible here
```

## Operators

Orus provides these operators with standard precedence rules:

### Arithmetic Operators
- `+` – Addition (numbers) or concatenation (strings)
- `-` – Subtraction
- `*` – Multiplication
- `/` – Division (integer division for i32/u32, floating point division for f64)
- `%` – Modulo (remainder after division)

### Comparison Operators
- `==` – Equal to
- `!=` – Not equal to
- `<` – Less than
- `>` – Greater than
- `<=` – Less than or equal to
- `>=` – Greater than or equal to

### Logical Operators
- `and` – Logical AND
- `or` – Logical OR
- `not` – Logical NOT (unary)

### Type Conversion

Type conversion must be performed explicitly, as Orus does not perform implicit type conversions between numeric types.

## Modules and Imports

Orus organizes code in files that serve as modules. The module system follows these rules:

- Files can be imported using the `import` statement with a string literal path
- Import statements must appear at the top level of a file, not inside functions
- Each file is executed only once during the program's lifetime, regardless of how many times it's imported
- Modules can contain function definitions, struct definitions, and `impl` blocks

Example:
```orus
import "path/to/module.orus"  // Must appear at top level

fn main() {
    // Call functions from the imported module
    module_function()
}
```

### Program Entry Point

All Orus programs must define a `main` function, which serves as the entry point:

```orus
fn main() {
    // Program execution starts here
    print("Hello, world!")
}
```

Requirements:
- The `main` function must be defined (directly or via imports)
- Top-level code outside functions is not allowed except for imports and struct/impl definitions
- `let` declarations and statements must be inside functions

## Functions

Functions are defined with the `fn` keyword and follow these rules:

- Parameter types must be explicitly declared
- Return type is specified with the `->` syntax
- If a return type is declared, all code paths must return a value of that type
- Functions without a return type declaration implicitly return `nil`
- Parameters are passed by value

Examples:
```orus
// Function with parameters and return value
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    return a + b
}

// Function with multiple return paths
fn max(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    if a > b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}

// Function with no explicit return (returns nil)
fn greet(name: string) {
    print("Hello, {}!", name)
}

// Recursive function
fn factorial(n: i32) -> i32 {
    if n <= 1 {
        return 1
    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
}
```

## Control Flow

Orus provides the following control flow constructs:

### Conditionals

```orus
// Simple if
if condition {
    // code executed if condition is true
}

// If-else
if condition {
    // code executed if condition is true
} else {
    // code executed if condition is false
}

// If-elif-else chain
if condition1 {
    // code for condition1
} elif condition2 {
    // code for condition2
} elif condition3 {
    // code for condition3
} else {
    // default case
}
```

### Loops

```orus
// For loop with range
for i in 0..10 {       // Range is inclusive of start, exclusive of end (0 to 9)
    print(i)
}

// While loop
while condition {
    // code executed as long as condition is true
}
```

### Loop Control

```orus
// Break statement (exits the loop)
while true {
    if condition {
        break           // Exits the loop immediately
    }
}

// Continue statement (skips to next iteration)
for i in 0..10 {
    if i % 2 == 0 {
        continue        // Skip even numbers, continue with next iteration
    }
    print(i)            // Only prints odd numbers
}
```

## Methods with `impl`

Methods are defined inside `impl` blocks attached to a struct type:

```orus
struct Rectangle {
    width: i32,
    height: i32
}

impl Rectangle {
    // Instance method (requires an instance of Rectangle)
    fn area(self) -> i32 {
        return self.width * self.height
    }
    
    // Static method (creates and returns a new Rectangle)
    fn new(w: i32, h: i32) -> Rectangle {
        return Rectangle{
            width: w,
            height: h
        }
    }
}
```

Usage:
```orus
fn main() {
    // Call static method
    let rect = Rectangle.new(5, 10)
    
    // Call instance method
    let a = rect.area()  // Returns 50
}
```

Key points:
- Instance methods receive `self` as their first parameter
- Static methods are called with the struct name followed by a dot
- Instance methods are called on instances of the struct
- Multiple `impl` blocks can be defined for the same struct

## Printing and String Formatting

Orus provides a built-in `print` function for console output:

```orus
// Simple printing
print("Hello, world!")

// String interpolation with placeholders
let name = "Alice"
let age = 30
print("{} is {} years old", name, age)  // Alice is 30 years old

// Print expressions
print("The result is: {}", 10 * 5 + 2)
```

String interpolation features:
- Each `{}` placeholder is replaced with the corresponding argument
- Arguments are converted to strings automatically
- The number of placeholders should match the number of additional arguments

## String Operations

Orus supports the following string operations:

```orus
// String concatenation with +
let greeting = "Hello, " + "world!"

// String length
let length = len("Hello")  // 5

// Substring extraction: substring(str, start, end)
let part = substring("Hello, world!", 0, 5)  // "Hello"
```

## Error Handling

Orus provides exception-like error handling with `try`/`catch` blocks:

```orus
try {
    // Code that might cause an error
    let result = 10 / 0  // Division by zero error
} catch err {
    // Error handling code
    print("Error occurred: {}", err)
}
```

Error types:
- Runtime errors (e.g., division by zero)
- Type errors (e.g., incompatible types in an operation)
- I/O errors (e.g., failed file operations)

Error messages include the location of the failure using the format
`file:line:column: message`. When an error unwinds through function calls,
a short stack trace is printed showing the call chain.

## Generics

The Orus language itself doesn't have generic syntax, but the C interpreter implementation provides macro-based generic data structures for internal use:

```c
// C macro to define type-specific array operations
DEFINE_ARRAY_TYPE(int, Int);

IntArray array;
initIntArray(&array);
writeIntArray(&array, 42);
freeIntArray(&array);
```

This feature is primarily for internal interpreter development, not for Orus language users.

For more details on this implementation approach, see `docs/GENERICS.md`.

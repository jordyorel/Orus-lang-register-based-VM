# [ARCHIVED] Orus Compilation Ideas

**NOTE: This document contains historical notes about compilation that are NOT part of the current Orus development roadmap.**

This document contains speculative ideas about how compilation could potentially be approached, should it ever become relevant. However, Orus is designed as an interpreted language, and there are no current plans to pursue compilation.

## Current Status

- [x] Functioning interpreter implementation
- [x] AST-based execution model
- [x] Type system foundation
- [ ] Native compilation pipeline (optional future enhancement)

## Future Optional Tasks

### IR (Intermediate Representation) Design
- [ ] Design LLVM-compatible IR structure
- [ ] Create IR generation pass from AST
- [ ] Implement basic optimization passes
- [ ] Document IR specification
- [ ] Add IR visualization tools

### Type System Adaptations
- [ ] Adapt the existing type system for compilation
- [ ] Extend type checking for compilation context
- [ ] Design compilation strategy for generics
- [ ] Create type verification passes for compiled code
- [ ] Implement monomorphization for generic code
- [ ] Ensure forward declarations work consistently in compiled code

### Core Compilation Pipeline
- [ ] Evaluate LLVM vs other backends
- [ ] Implement compilation driver
- [ ] Create target-specific code generation
- [ ] Develop linking strategy for external libraries
- [ ] Add debug information generation

## Other Compilation Tasks

### Compiler Optimizations
- [ ] Implement inlining for performance-critical functions
- [ ] Add dead code elimination
- [ ] Create constant folding and propagation passes
- [ ] Implement loop optimizations
- [ ] Add tail call optimization

### Standard Library Adaptation
- [ ] Convert runtime functions to compile-time equivalents
- [ ] Create precompiled library modules
- [ ] Implement platform abstraction layer
- [ ] Develop foreign function interface (FFI)
- [ ] Build cross-platform standard library

### Build System
- [ ] Create package/module management system
- [ ] Implement dependency resolution
- [ ] Add incremental compilation support
- [ ] Create multi-platform build configurations
- [ ] Develop integrated build tools

## Lower Priority Tasks

### Toolchain Integration
- [ ] Develop integrated debugger support
- [ ] Create profile-guided optimization tools
- [ ] Implement source-level debugging
- [ ] Add language server protocol support
- [ ] Create IDE integration plugins

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation
- [ ] Add just-in-time (JIT) compilation option
- [ ] Create cross-compilation toolchain
- [ ] Implement link-time optimization
- [ ] Add platform-specific intrinsics

### Documentation and Resources
- [ ] Create compiler architecture documentation
- [ ] Develop compiler extension guide
- [ ] Write optimization guide for users
- [ ] Add examples for common compilation patterns
- [ ] Document platform-specific considerations

## Compatibility Strategy

### Interpreter Compatibility
- [ ] Ensure identical behavior in interpreted and compiled modes
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for verified output
- [ ] Implement gradual migration path for existing codebases
- [ ] Add compilation flags for behavior alignment
- [ ] Document differences when unavoidable

### ABI and Interface Stability
- [ ] Design stable ABI for compiled modules
- [ ] Create versioning scheme for compiled artifacts
- [ ] Implement compatibility layer for mixed-mode execution
- [ ] Document binary compatibility guarantees
- [ ] Develop tooling for ABI verification

## Implementation Considerations

### Potential Timeline (If Pursued)
- **Exploration Phase**: 3-6 months post version 1.0
  - Research compilation strategies
  - Evaluate backend options
  - Prototype core components
  
- **Implementation Phase**: 6-12 months
  - IR design and implementation
  - Core compilation logic
  - Standard library adaptation

- **Refinement Phase**: 3-6 months
  - Optimizations
  - Toolchain integration
  - Documentation

## Why Compilation Might Be Valuable

Compilation could provide several benefits to the Orus ecosystem:
- Performance improvements for compute-intensive applications
- Static analysis opportunities
- Deployment flexibility
- Integration with systems programming contexts

## Why Compilation Remains Optional

Orus is designed to be an effective interpreted language with:
- Good performance through its optimized VM
- Strong type system that catches errors at runtime
- Flexibility and dynamic features that some compiled languages struggle with
- Simpler development workflow without compilation steps

## Additional Resources
- Existing compiler references: LLVM, GCC, Clang
- Related language implementations: Rust, Swift, Go
- Academic papers on efficient compilation strategies
- LLVM documentation and tutorials

## Known Challenges
- Garbage collection in compiled environment
- Exception handling across compilation boundaries
- Generic specialization vs. code bloat
- Debug information generation
- Cross-platform consistency
- Preserving interpreter semantics exactly

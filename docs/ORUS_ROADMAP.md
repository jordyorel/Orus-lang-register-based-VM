## Development Priorities

### Short-TermÂ 

* Finalize generic forward declarations
* Add remaining built-ins: `abs`, `round`, `any`, `all`
* Begin core standard library: `math`, `random`, `functional`

### Medium-Term&#x20;

* Generic constraints and arithmetic
* Build out I/O, date/time, strings, and collections
* Improve diagnostics and error reporting

### Long-Term

* Full concurrency model with async/thread support
* Language optimizations and bytecode performance
* Prepare stable 1.0 release

## Versioning Strategy

### Semantic Versioning

* **Major** (1.0.0): Stability milestone
* **Minor** (0.x.0): Features like generics, collections
* **Patch** (0.0.x): Fixes, minor additions

### Compatibility

* Backward compatibility maintained during 0.x phase
* Breaking changes clearly documented
* Migration tools/guides for major version jumps

# Array Implementation Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive tests for the new modern array implementation in the Orus register VM.

## Overview

The array implementation has been completely redesigned from scratch with modern engineering practices, enhanced safety, and improved performance. This test suite validates all aspects of the new implementation.

  - Runs all array tests automatically
  - Provides detailed result reporting
  - Tests both new and legacy array functionality
  - Returns appropriate exit codes for CI/CD integration

## Key Features Tested

### âœ… Implemented and Tested

1. **Core Infrastructure**
   - Array creation with proper capacity management
   - Element access with comprehensive bounds checking
   - Element assignment with safety validation
   - Length operations with O(1) performance

2. **Enhanced Safety Features**
   - Python-style negative indexing (`arr[-1]` for last element)
   - Comprehensive bounds checking with detailed error messages
   - Type safety validation
   - Overflow protection

3. **Dynamic Operations**
   - Smart growth algorithm (2x capacity doubling)
   - Dynamic push operations with automatic resizing
   - Pop operations with bounds validation
   - Memory-efficient operations

4. **Type System Integration**
   - Full garbage collection support
   - String conversion with recursive formatting
   - Type introspection capabilities
   - Mixed-type array support

5. **Performance Characteristics**
   - O(1) element access
   - O(1) amortized push/pop operations
   - Efficient memory usage
   - Smart capacity management

### ðŸ”„ Future Implementation

- Array slicing (`arr[start..end]`)
- Advanced methods (insert, remove, slice, reverse, sort)
- Functional programming operations (map, filter, reduce)
- Array concatenation with `+` operator
- Array comprehensions

## Running the Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
./run_array_tests.sh
```

### Run Individual Tests
```bash
# Basic functionality
./orusc test_basic_array_ops.orus

# Register VM opcodes
./orusc test_register_vm_opcodes.orus

# Performance testing
./orusc test_array_performance.orus

# Error handling
./orusc test_array_errors.orus

# Comprehensive testing
./orusc test_new_array_implementation.orus
```

## Expected Results

The test suite is designed to validate that:

1. **All core array operations work correctly**
2. **Performance is competitive with modern dynamic languages**
3. **Memory usage is efficient and predictable**
4. **Error handling is comprehensive and safe**
5. **Code quality follows Orus engineering standards**

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers:

- âœ… **Unit Testing**: Every register VM opcode tested individually
- âœ… **Integration Testing**: Complete feature interaction validation
- âœ… **Performance Testing**: Growth patterns, access speed, memory efficiency
- âœ… **Error Testing**: Bounds checking, type safety, edge cases
- âœ… **Stress Testing**: Large arrays, bulk operations, memory pressure
- ðŸ”„ **Compatibility Testing**: Legacy code integration (pending stack VM fixes)

## Notes

- Some tests may fail if the stack VM to register VM translation layer is not fully updated
- The register VM implementation itself is production-ready and passes all core functionality tests
- Performance tests demonstrate that the new implementation meets or exceeds the original performance
- Error handling tests validate that all safety features work correctly

## Contributing

When adding new array features:

1. Add corresponding test cases to the appropriate test file
2. Update this README with new test coverage
3. Ensure the test runner includes the new tests
4. Validate that all existing tests continue to pass
